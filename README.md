# Ethical Hacker tools
 There was event called KrakYourNet... Recently I've been beginning a new chapter in that adventure with Cisco NetAcad.
 - these first two tools I created during IT lab on my university.
 - with 't-o-c-1.py' you can take over control over network devices(obviously you had to gain admin data like username or password)
 
Legal Note
Version with Nmap is usually passive and legal, but you should still have permission from the owner of the host being scanned or 
the appropriate network permissions.
