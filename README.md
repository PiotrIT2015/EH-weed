# Ethical Hacker tools
 There was event called KrakYourNet... Recently I've been beginning a new chapter in that adventure with Cisco NetAcad.
 - these first two tools I created during IT lab on my university.
 - with 't-o-c-1.py' you can take over control over network devices(obviously you had to gain admin data like username or password)
